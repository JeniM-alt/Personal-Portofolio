MY PORTOFOLIO PROJECT

Itâ€™s an interactive website where I added informations about myself, my experiences and my  projects and also how to get in touch with me. I made this project to apply the concepts and the technologies i have learned at CodersLab, as a final product which is a full website and i used HTML5, SCSS, ECMAScript 6, JavaScript and for icons FontAwesome.
#
I have two favorite parts about this project, the first one is the use of Sass for a very quick complete change of the site and the second one it's that i made transitions for the menu change.
